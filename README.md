image-tools: 
  1. find similar images
  
  two versions, one just goes through all pairs of images in a folder and sorts them by similarity
  2nd version you choose one image and then it finds all the similar ones (<0.15 diff) and moves everything into a new folder
  
  2. also got mass renaming tool
